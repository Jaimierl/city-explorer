## Deployed Link
https://city-explorer-jae.netlify.app/

## Overview
This app provides information to a user so they can learn more about a city they are curious about. The site will return the latitude and longitude of the city as well as a map of the city.

## Getting Started
To create this site for themselves, a user would build a react app and inport bootstrap and axios. Then they would go to LocationIQ and set up an API and Netlify/github to host the site. Then they would build out the react app to gather the user information and send it to Location IQ, and display the results including a map and an error log.

## Architecture
Using React, Axios, and Server

## Change Log
10/7 Application deployed to Netlify
10/9 Application map working

## Credit and Collaborations
